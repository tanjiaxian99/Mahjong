## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development:
* Real-time multiplayer experience, with lobby and private room creation

* Customisable points scoring (e.g. instead of the usual 2 points for a Triplets Hand, the setting can be adjusted to give 3 points)
* Localisation for English, Chinese (Simplified) and Chinese (Traditional)

To-do list:
* Improve UI/UX
* Chat function
* Manual arrangement of tiles
* AI for singleplayer
